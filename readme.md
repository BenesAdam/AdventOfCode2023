# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

![Advent of Code Logo](img/advent_of_code.jpeg)

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles released daily throughout the month of December.

## Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day having its own dedicated directory (`day01`, `day02`, etc.). Inside each day's directory, you'll find the solutions implemented in C++.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:BenesAdam/AdventOfCode2023.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd AdventOfCode2023
    ```

3. Click right and open it with Visual Studio
